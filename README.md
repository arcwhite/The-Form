This is just an example comment/sign-up form, using PHP, jQuery and HTML.
We're using the RedBean ORM for maximum efficiency (it's pretty neat for quick dev work).

Requirements:
PHP 5.3

Setup:
create database pollenizer_test;
grant all on pollenizer_test.* to 'pollenizer_test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

That should be all you need.
