The Form
=======================
This is just an example comment/sign-up form, using PHP, jQuery and HTML.
We're using the RedBean ORM for maximum efficiency (it's pretty neat for quick dev work).

Requirements:
----------------
PHP 5.3

Setup:
-----------------
In MySQL...

    	create database pollenizer_test;
    	grant all on pollenizer_test.* to 'pollenizer_test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';


You'll then need to copy config.php.default to config.php, and edit that file to enter correct values for your environment.

That should be all you need.
